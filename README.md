<h2 align="center"> Purpose of Anaylsis</h2>
The purpose of this project was to create an informative dashboard analyzing New York City Citi-Bike data with the use of Tableau.  The idea behind this analysis is to showcase our findings in effort to expand this business model to Des Moines, Iowa.  This project specifically analyzes data of Citi-Bike rentals in New York City from August 2019.

<h2 align="center"> Results</h2>

<h3 align="center"> Top Starting Locations</h3>

![Top Starting Locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89044350/143085111-30cdc078-0c63-4310-a4ea-0a2fc1ff59a2.JPG)
The above image shows the Top Starting Locations of Citi Bike rentals in NYC.  As you can see, the most popular Starting Locations are in the downtown area of Manhattan.

<h3 align="center"> Top Ending Locations</h3>

![Top Ending Locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89044350/143085628-7f932bf9-c692-47fc-ae6e-9e4f218bcd28.JPG)
The above image shows the Top Ending Locations of Citi Bike rentals in NYC.  Again, like the Top Starting Locations, the Top Ending Locations fall within the downtown Manhattan area.  This would suggest that renters are not traveling far from their initial starting location when utilizing Citi-Bike as their method of transportation.

<h3 align="center"> Ride Duration Times (Minutes)</h3>

![Trip Durations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89044350/143086010-84f513ec-edd1-44ee-8806-b8947b106053.JPG)
The above illustration shows the number of Citi-Bikes rented and their respective travel durations.  As you can see, most bikes rented have a travel duration of approximately 5 minutes.  This further goes on to show that users of Citi-Bike are not typically traveling far, which correlates with our Top Starting and Ending locations. 

<h3 align="center"> Trips by Weekday per Hour Heatmap</h3>

![Trip Density per Hour per Day](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89044350/143088483-d67281f3-85f0-45d3-baf9-9de423542960.JPG)
This illustration above shows the busiest times of day in respect to the number of bikes rented per hour, breaking down all 7 days of the week.  As you can see, morning and evening hours are the busiest times Monday through Friday.  The weekends show to be a bit busier late morning into early evening.  This would suggest users are renting bikes to commute to and from work during the week, and for leisure travel during the weekends.  The lower rental rates later into the evening (after 8pm) could suggest users are utilizing a taxi service to return home, perhaps after drinking socially or eating a large dinner with friends and/or colleagues. 

<h3 align="center"> Gender Breakdown Pie Chart</h3>

![Gender Breakdown Pie Chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89044350/143089186-8978a580-74c7-485e-bd3a-09483f27cd0d.JPG)
This simple pie chart displays the gender breakdown of Citi-Bike renters.  As shown, males show to be much high users of the Citi-Bike service over females. Further analysis would need to be performed to determine exactly why.  One could suggest that males may feel safer using the service during the early morning, or late evening hours traveling in downtown Manhattan, where females traveling alone may feel more comfortable utilizing a taxi, or the NYC Subway system during those times.  

<h3 align="center"> Trip Duration Time by Gender (Minutes)</h3>

![Trip Duration by Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89044350/143089843-22f80fff-0212-4c50-be2e-448f5ad3583c.JPG)
The above image breaksdown the number of rentals by gender, and their respective travel durations.  As shown, males again utilize the rental service much more than females, however the travel durations basically match.  This again could suggest that females prefer other methods of public transportation during the early morning hours. 

<h3 align="center"> Trips by Gender (Weekdays per Hour) Heatmap</h3>

![Trip Count by Gender by Hours](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89044350/143090282-b0f03690-ad27-4a91-bcf0-b2f410dd73a8.JPG)
The above heatmap displays the rental count by gender for a specific hour during a period of 7 days.  This heatmap again shows that males utilize the Citi-Bike service much more than females. A quick snapshot shows that on Thursdays at 8am, there are 25,694 Citi-Bikes rented by males, while during the exact same time period only 9,740 rented by females. Looking at the "Unknown" segment, another 1,080 rentals are made on Thursdays.  It would be easy to assume that the majoriy of these rentals are made by males.  

<h3 align="center"> UserType Trips by Gender by Weekday</h3>

![UserType Trips by Gender by Weekdays](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89044350/143091026-e1c9fb16-fc15-44f1-a46d-07646783c360.JPG)
This final image shows a breakdown of renters by their "user type".  User type is defined as a "Customer" or "Subscriber".  As shown, there are substantially more male subscribers to the citi-bike service as compared to females.  This display also shows Thursdays and Fridays to be the most popular days to rent a Citi-Bike.

<h2 align="center"> Summary of Analysis</h2>
Based on our analysis and the illustrations provided above it is easy to conclude that males much prefer this type of service over females in NYC.  It's also easy to conclude that Citi-Bike is a very popular method of public transportation.  The use shows to stay pretty concentrated in the Downtown Manahattan area, especially during the work week, picking up around 8am and 5pm-6pm respectively.  The ride durations hanging around the 5 minute mark also explain why the highest rental concentrations stay in the downtown area.  

If the goal is to expand this type of service to Des Moines, Iowa additional analyzation should occur.  It would be beneficial to know why there is such a difference between male and female use. Additionally, how many rentals are made by NYC residents as compared to tourists.  Some questions to help investigate further could be:
1. What is the male population compared to female population in both cities?
2. What is the average age for both males and females in both cities?
3. What is the working population of males and females in both cities?
4. How many rentals/subscribers are NYC residents compared to tourists?
5. What type of revenue does Des Moines generate from tourism as compared to New York City?

A quick Google search shows that the as of 2020 the current population of Des Moines, Iowa is 214,133.  The current population of New York City as of 2020 is 8.4 Million.  This is an astronomical difference. Another quick Google search shows that in 2019, New York City generated approximately $80.3 Billion from 66.6 million visitors.  Des Moines Iowa generated approximately $2 Billion from nearly 14 Million visitors.  Serious analytics would need to be performed to determine the amount of units (bikes) needed, and the profit margin of each unit.  How much revenue is generated as compared to maintenace costs, or complete loss of an asset?  It would be wise to pull data on a similar business model in a city more comparable to Des Moines, Iowa.  New York City is massive, and hard to compare to any other city in the United States.
